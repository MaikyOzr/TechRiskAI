# **App Name**: TechRisk

## Core Features:

- Project Input: Users can provide technical context via text input, code snippets, logs, or configuration fragments.
- AI Risk Analysis: Uses an LLM (Gemini) to perform a strict, evidence-based audit, identifying technical risks, architecture problems, scalability limitations, security concerns, and quick improvement opportunities.
- Executive Summary: Generates a non-technical summary explaining overall system health, risk level, business urgency, and high-level recommendations, designed specifically for CEOs, CTOs, and product owners.
- Structured Risk Report: Each issue includes a clear description, evidence (based only on provided data), business impact (cost, downtime, growth limits), and severity level (low / medium / high).
- Actionable Recommendations: Provides concrete “quick wins”, estimated effort (low / medium / high), and expected business benefit (stability, cost reduction, scalability).
- Analysis History: Saves past analyses per user and allows reviewing and comparing reports over time.
- Shareable Report: Generates a secure, shareable link to enable sharing results with stakeholders or team members.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep neutral blue or graphite (trust, stability, enterprise focus)
- Background color: Light neutral gray or off-white (clarity, readability)
- Accent color: Muted amber or soft red for highlighting risks and severity
- Body font: 'Inter' (excellent for B2B)
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (tech-oriented, modern)
- Clean, enterprise-style layout with clear separation between executive view and technical details.
- Strong visual hierarchy with severity indicators and section grouping.
- Minimalist icons for Risk, Security, Performance, and Architecture.
- Subtle transitions when analysis completes or sections expand/collapse; no decorative or playful motion.
