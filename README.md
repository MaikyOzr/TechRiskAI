# Risk Assessment Desktop Application

A local-first desktop application designed for assessing technical and security risks in complex systems. Empowers technical leaders, security auditors, and engineers to perform rapid, evidence-based risk analysis without relying on slow external audits or exposing sensitive data to the cloud.

## Overview

This application provides a comprehensive framework for identifying, analyzing, and managing technical and security risks in your infrastructure and systems. All data remains local on your machine, ensuring complete privacy and control over sensitive security information.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Installation instructions will be added based on your build system
npm install
npm start
```

### Basic Usage

1. Create a new risk assessment project
2. Define your system components and architecture
3. Identify potential risks and threats
4. Assess likelihood and impact
5. Document evidence and mitigation strategies
6. Generate reports for stakeholders

## Core Capabilities

### Risk Identification
Systematically identify technical and security risks across your systems, including infrastructure vulnerabilities, architectural weaknesses, and operational risks.

### Risk Analysis
Evaluate each risk based on likelihood and potential impact, using customizable risk matrices and scoring systems.

### Evidence Management
Attach documentation, logs, screenshots, and other evidence directly to risk assessments for comprehensive audit trails.

### Mitigation Tracking
Document and monitor risk mitigation strategies, assign owners, and track remediation progress.

### Reporting
Generate detailed reports for different audiences, from executive summaries to technical deep-dives.

## Privacy & Security

- **No Cloud Storage**: All data remains on your local machine
- **No External Dependencies**: No API calls or external service requirements
